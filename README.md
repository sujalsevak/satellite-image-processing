# satellite-image-processing

This project uses Python libraries such as **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib** to process and analyze satellite images. It provides functionality for working with image data, performing calculations, and visualizing results with graphs and images.

## Features

- Read and manipulate satellite image data using NumPy.
- Process image data and apply transformations.
- Visualize data with Matplotlib charts and image displays.
- Handle various image formats (e.g., PNG, JPEG) and numerical datasets.

## Libraries Used

- **NumPy**: For numerical computations and image processing.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and handling structured data.
- **Matplotlib**: For generating plots and visualizations.

## Installation

To get started, you'll need to install the required Python libraries. Use the following command to install them:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
